Malik Rabb (123) 456-7891 mrabb@email.com May 1, 2018 To Whom It May Concern, I read about your online posting for Actors for a new film in town and would love to be considered for a part. I have been working toward my dream of becoming a full-time Actor for years now, and a role in your Cloud Clearwater Productions film could be the vital next step in my journey. My love of acting developed at an early age. I was on the stage as soon as I could walk. I starred in films as a young child when I was in middle school as well as high school. I took part in local town performances as well. Once I attended school at Hawaii Western, my acting took a turn. I majored in Theater Arts, really putting my skills and passion to the test. Besides performing in plays through school, I also continued to monitor for local performances and opportunities. I take pride in admitting the parts I gained over the years from college to today. I was fortunate enough to star in three major productions: “Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat,” “Othello,” and a version of “The Lion King” that showed my stage athleticism. I have also played key parts in plays and films that didn’t include a starring role. Side and complementary characters are often just as important to the execution of a story as the main character is. They often bring the problem and/or the climax. They can aid the hero in reaching a goal. Oftentimes, the ultimate success or failure of a project depends on the supporting cast, and I know this intimately. I hope to be a part of that cast in your endeavor to show just what I can do. Sincerely, Malik Rabb"

Sofia Flores (123) 456-7891 sflores@email.com May 1, 2018 To Whom It May Concern, I have two passions in life. The first is creating and nurturing art. The second is working with children to help them create as well. I cannot help but think the opportunity to become an Art Teacher at River Tech is the perfect place for me. My love of art started at a very young age. I was constantly drawing, painting, sewing, and frankly, ruining. Not all art generated by a child is going to be beneficial! But from staining a few too many surfaces at my parents’ house, I grew passionate about my skills. I took the next step by attending Longford Tech. Teaching wasn’t immediately on my radar, but it soon followed. I honed my craft while simultaneously expanding my horizons. A love of art grew into a love of helping others with their art, and eventually, teaching others. After graduation, I worked at Retail Ocean, a studio in town. Not all students were children, which actually worked to my benefit. I learned the different patterns necessary to teach students of all ages and skill levels. And just because someone is older does not mean they are more advanced in a specific technique or craft. The balance aided me greatly as I moved to working exclusively with children. Even children have vastly different learning curves. And finding each student’s learning technique is part of the fun. Seeing a young child create a piece of art after hardly knowing the first step to doing so is a joy that cannot be matched. Becoming an Art Teacher at River Tech would stoke this joy, and I would love to be considered for the position. Sincerely, Sofia Flores"
"Dear Hiring Manager, I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Artist position at Cloud Clearwater. As a lifelong artist, I am confident in my ability to create expressive and interesting pieces that match the needs of your clientele. Based on my experience and education, I feel that I am well-suited for the Artist position. Ever since I could hold a pencil, I have been creating works of art. From pencil sketches to pastel drawings to Bob Ross-inspired paintings, I did it all. At a very early age, I knew what I wanted to do with my life. In high school, I took Advanced Placement Art and won several awards. By the time I finished high school, I knew that my area of expertise was painting. The walls of my childhood home are still covered with my paintings. During my education at Longford Tech I studied art history, design, drawing, color theory, and painting. Throughout college, my work was selected to be in many art shows, including the TradeLot Art Show, one of the biggest shows on the West Coast. My paintings featured a wide range of subjects such as mermaids, people, sailboats, beaches, monuments, plants, and much more. My favorite element to experiment with is color. I enjoy seeing how a colorful painting can add brightness to any room. The most rewarding part of being an artist is seeing the face of the client when they see their finished order. Thank you for your time and consideration of my application. I look forward to learning about Cloud Clearwater and its clients. I feel that the Artist position will allow me to utilize my well-practiced skills to add value to your company. Sincerely, Malik Rabb"

Sofia Flores (123) 456-7891 sflores@email.com May 1, 2018 To Whom It May Concern, I am inquiring about your opening for Assistant Principal at River Tech and would love to be considered for the position. I believe I have the necessary compassion and leadership skills to excel at such an opportunity. My experiences and skills align perfectly with what would be required of me at River Tech. My teaching experience began as a graduate assistant at Green Valley State. There, balancing my own schoolwork with teaching, I learned to appreciate both sides of the student dynamic. Students often take teachers for granted, and teachers often expect too much or predict too little of their students. Being able to witness both sides simultaneously was a real benefit to my growth. Upon graduating, I accepted a teaching job at Crane & Jenkins where I was able to hone my abilities in the classroom, working with a class load of nearly 120 students my first year. For the next five years, I continued this work, not only serving as an English teacher but also organizing numerous school clubs and organizations like Best Buddies and 4-H. While working at Crane & Jenkins, I would also arrange events and meetings at the school, working as a liaison between students, faculty, and parents. Working with the teachers and the students is what I want to continue to do. I am also fond of what I have read about River Tech.

"Dear Hiring Manager, One of my strongest desires is to help nurture and care for children. When I saw the opening for Babysitter at Crane & Jenkins, it felt like the perfect opportunity and something I must pursue. I have been doing jobs in this capacity since I was young myself. Starting out as a camp counselor, I was responsible for watching groups of children ranging from 8 to 20 kids. Besides keeping them out of danger, I also created games and schedules for my groups to follow. Though counselor work was just during summers, I branched off into babysitting during the school months. It turned out this was perfect for me. I began that “career” with just three different children under my watch on different days of the week. Through word of mouth and the barest of marketing strategies, I tripled my client list within three months of starting out. That growth was thanks to a good neighborhood but also my skill and success at the job. Though babysitting doesn’t require as much activity as being a camp counselor, it is more focused on safety and care. Those are things that are vitally important to me. Keeping a child safe must be the main focus of a Babysitter. At Crane & Jenkins, I know there is a new vibe compared to what I am used to. Rather than going to the child’s home, the child comes to us. That should work to my benefit as I grow comfortable with the environment. It will begin to feel like the child is coming to my home turf, which makes keeping them safe and happy even easier. Sincerely, Sofia Flores"

"Dear Hiring Manager, I am not just another young adult looking for a job at a coffee shop. I live and breathe coffee, and I absolutely adore Cloud Clearwater. I am excited to apply for the Barista opening at Cloud Clearwater because I am passionate about foam, caffeine, and smiling, and I love the inviting atmosphere. At my last position as Barista for the coffee shop at Retail Ocean, I perfected our signature coffee swirl in a record two weeks. In 14 days, I learned to not only make the lattes themselves but also craft an absolutely perfect Retail Ocean wave atop the steaming cup, and I know that I could quickly learn to craft any foam creation for this new position. Beyond that, I would love to branch out from my coffee interests to pastries, teas, and the other menu items offered at Cloud Clearwater. I am outgoing, extroverted, and would easily blend with the already vibrant staff employed with Cloud Clearwater. I work extremely well under pressure, and I am able to grin on cue despite the morning and evening rushes that might stress some people out. In addition to all of these skills, I also have a fantastic memory and have been known to memorize drink orders to faces, therefore speeding up clogged lines. Along with these behind-the-counter talents, I am also dedicated to the tasks that aren’t coffee related too. Stocking can be fun, and I would love to join the team to be the Barista you need when you need it! Thank you so much for your consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon.

I’ve been a Bartender for 15 years, working at restaurants, golf clubs, and martini lounges. And the clientele of Cloud Clearwater is similar to that of several of the places where I have served previously. Most recently, I worked as the shift lead at my previous establishment, a martini lounge that attracts many professionals and paraprofessionals for business meetings and after-work cocktails. In that role, I trained incoming Bartenders on our specialty drinks and our standards for customer service and mixing. I also revised our procedures for ensuring food safety and implemented an internal food safety audit. Additionally, I also created a signature drink that is a spin-off a salted caramel martini and plays well with the current general culinary trend of salt with chocolate or caramel. I often receive compliments from the owners that I am very capable of engaging with people, both the staff and customers. I am also complimented on my ability to correct newer Bartenders in a way that is encouraging but also serves the guest in a timely fashion. I would love the opportunity to talk to you in person, meet your current staff, and learn more about your establishment.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Caregiver position at Crane & Jenkins. As a highly empathetic and caring individual with extensive experience in the caregiving field, I am confident that I can succeed as a Caregiver at Crane & Jenkins, a trusted name in geriatric care since 1990. During my tenure at River Tech, I provided home health care for a rotation of 10 patients per week, five days a week. My responsibilities included light housework, giving baths, preparing small snacks, reading to patients, helping them around the house, helping patients use the restroom, providing companionship, keeping track of appointments, and feeding patients. I am very passionate about the well-being of my patients. I believe that the elderly are a valuable and important generation, full of wisdom and knowledge and that they need to be cared for and protected. During my teenage years, I served as a primary caregiver for my grandmother. As a frail woman in her late 90s, she needed a lot of assistance with most day-to-day functions. Since I was there more than my parents, who both worked full-time, I took it upon myself to be her caregiver.

"Dear Hiring Manager, Writing a great Chef cover letter is an important step in your job search journey. When writing a cover letter, be sure to reference the requirements listed in the job description. In your letter, reference your most relevant or exceptional qualifications to help employers see why you’re a great fit for the role. In the same way that you might reference resume samples, the following Chef cover letter example will help you to write a cover letter that best highlights your experience and qualifications. If you’re ready to apply for your next role, upload your resume to Indeed Resume to get started.) Sofia Flores (123) 456-7891 sflores@email.com May 1, 2018 To Whom It May Concern, A young Chef always dreams of creating their own menu. When I became aware of the opening at Cloud Clearwater, I knew it was the right opportunity for me to pursue. It would be a dream come true to even be seriously considered for this position of Chef. It would mean all my hard work was paying off. I spent some time early in my life at Longford Tech. Though I didn’t complete my full degree, it was five semesters well spent. My time at school helped me learn and focus on what I really wanted to do with my life: cook. Throughout school, besides attending business classes, I grew my hobby into my passion. Instead of staying for my full degree at Longford Tech, I moved to a great opportunity when the time was right. The chance to work and create in a kitchen at a real restaurant was too intriguing to pass up. Though I wasn’t creating the menu by any means, my position at TradeLot allowed me to do the next best thing. It prepared me for the work and desire it takes to create and run a menu, and I learned that the best dishes often come from tweaks to original plans. If given the opportunity to create my own menu at Cloud Clearwater, I know I will not waste it. This is the chance I have been waiting for since leaving school early and seeking out my passion of cooking. Even before getting started, I know every test meal will not be a hit. However, I can promise that every piece of food that makes it to the customers will be my best effort. Sincerely, Sofia Flores"
"Dear Hiring Manager, I was very excited to see your posting for the Civil Engineer position at River Tech. I have been working in the engineering field for several years, and during that time I have been a part of multiple projects, including ones that focused on the maintenance of several roads and the design of Cloud Clearwater Bridge. I am particularly detail oriented, and I have always been praised for my ability to foresee potential problems and make proactive plans. In my previous role as Civil Engineer, I was responsible for examining the stability of the bridge that we were building and assessing how it would withstand an earthquake. I also helped with the maintenance and upgrading of several roads that needed drainage to make the roads safer for travel and improve the longevity of the road’s surface. I am not only attentive to detail when designing and maintaining roads and bridges. I am also attentive to the criticism of others, and I highly value feedback that will make my projects run more smoothly. I appreciate straightforward yet relaxed professional interactions, and I aim for that dynamic with all of my colleagues and outside contacts. I sincerely look forward to further discussing the role of Civil Engineer at River Tech. I’m also excited to hear more about some of the projects that River Tech has been involved in as well as any projects in the foreseeable future.

Malik Rabb (123) 456-7891 mrabb@email.com May 1, 2018 To Whom It May Concern, As I strive to become the best Coach I can be, I am currently scouting for positions that would allow me to do so. After seeing the opening for Coach at Green Valley State, I know this is a perfect fit for me and would love the opportunity to prove myself. My coaching career began as a graduate assistant in school. I worked while attending Coral Springs University. While it was occasionally tricky to balance school with my duties as an Assistant Coach, the work was entirely worth it. I wouldn’t be where I am today without that start. After graduating, I stayed on at CSU to continue helping the staff. My position was upgraded, as were my responsibilities. This was the jump I was looking for. Helping the students with their own school and sports balance was a dream. It wasn’t always easy, but that made it feel even better when results were witnessed. My first big break came in the form of a full-time Assistant Coaching position at Hawaii Western. As an assistant, I was tasked with forming my own game plans, making in-game adjustments, and constantly teaching the kids what was necessary to find success. It isn’t everyone who is as fortunate as me to be able to do what they love as a career. While that has remained true, my wish is to lead Green Valley State as Head Coach. This is a grand opportunity that fits into exactly what I have worked toward. You have a tremendous group of kids here, and I want to be a part of their growth into young men. Sincerely, Malik Rabb"

After school, I began the process of immersing myself in the dental industry. I found assistant work at Crane & Jenkins. Though just a young pup in the field, I could tell that this position would (and did) help a great deal. I learned the ins and outs of day-to-day operations at a dental office. This included interacting with prospective as well as current clients. I fine-tuned my bedside manner and, of course, sat at the hip of the dentist in residency. Since assistant work was hardly my end goal, I had to move on. But it wasn’t without reservation. I enjoyed my time at Crane & Jenkins and will remember a number of the clients rather fondly. Building relationships is one of my main draws to the profession. Sincerely, Sofia Flores"

"Dear Hiring Manager, I was informed of your opening for Event Coordinator at TradeLot and knew I must apply. This position lines up perfectly with my skills, experiences, and goals for the future. I previously attended Hawaii Western, earning my degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management. By working through real-world examples, we learned the ins and outs of many customer-focused businesses. Side work also gave me a solid background in finance and honed my organizational skills. It wasn’t enough to learn about customer service, though. I had to experience that for myself. After graduating, I became a Facilities and Events Assistant at Coral Springs University. There, I gained the entire blueprint of what an Event Coordinator is all about. Coordinating an event is about more than renting out a space. A room must be prepped. It must be organized and set up to the specifications of the client. Events must be monitored throughout. And when the event wraps, a coordinator’s job is not done. There is follow-up that must be adhered to. Though CSU was not hosting events as a for-profit enterprise, our department still worked through each step of the process. From CSU, I moved onto Cloud Clearwater Inn. This gave me personal knowledge of what happens when we are using it as a profit generator. It was yet another side of being an Event Coordinator. My hope to appease the client and do my best to adhere to their desires is what will make me a perfect fit at TradeLot. Sincerely, Sofia Flores"
"Dear Hiring Manager, I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Event Manager position at Cloud Clearwater. As a high-energy, experienced professional with an eye for detail, I firmly believe that I can provide Cloud Clearwater with outstanding event management services. My previous role as Event Manager at Crane & Jenkins included responsibilities like managing the event staff, coordinating the details of weddings, conferences, birthday parties, and charity events, hiring and training new staff, making budgets, booking venues, setting up decorations, and organizing catering. All of these responsibilities gave me valuable experience in all of the areas of event planning. I was determined to become an expert in each aspect of the job. It was very rewarding to see everything come together on the day of the event and the clients having a great time at their party. I first became interested in event planning when my mother decided to remarry. All of her friends tried to talk her out of having a wedding at all, but I encouraged her to plan a special ceremony. Since no one else wanted to help her plan the wedding, I took up the role as her personal wedding planner. I was only 21, but in just a few short months, I planned an entire wedding for my mother and executed it beautifully. Thank you for your time and consideration of my application. I anticipate learning more about Cloud Clearwater and its clients. I am confident that my experience and love for event planning will prove me to be an excellent fit for the Event Manager position at Cloud Clearwater. Sincerely, Ebony Moore"

As someone with a sharp eye for detail and a drive to organize, I thrive on making sure every day has a clear plan and every plan is clearly communicated.

In addition to being an expert at scheduling meetings, preparing agendas, and managing travel arrangements, I’ve also developed the ability to anticipate roadblocks and create effective alternative plans.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Finance Intern position at River Tech. As a finance student at Coral Springs University, I am excited to be applying for this position. Over the past three and a half years, I have become knowledgeable and well-versed in the field, and I feel confident in my ability to deliver in this position. During my academic career, I studied a variety of courses that have given me the knowledge I know I need to be successful in the finance field. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to learn about macroeconomics, microeconomics, personal finance, project management, business, accounting, and human resources management. I am an individual who pays very close attention to detail. I have the ability to solve complex financial issues, and I possess strong analytical skills. My oral and written communication skills are stellar. I perform well in fast-paced environments. Throughout my life I have been a natural mathematician. In high school, I took advanced math courses, college math courses, and went to a math camp each summer. During my junior and senior years, I was president of the math club and won the state championship. In college, I was a student tutor for the math department under the work-study program.

"Dear Hiring Manager, Thank you for the opportunity to apply for the Financial Analyst position at Cloud Clearwater. As a detail-oriented analyst with a passion for numbers, I am thrilled at the chance to develop successful strategic financial models based on my data-driven insights and wealth of industry expertise. With more than seven years as a Financial Analyst at River Tech, I held the responsibility of analyzing and refining intricate FP&A models for privately held, multimillion-dollar global organizations. I developed a series of recurring reports that enhanced our forecasting and budgeting processes. Those reports also significantly improved visibility into our clients’ revenue, expense and functional operations. River Tech’s executive team leveraged those reports to grow the company’s revenue by more than 28% over the last two years. During my decade of experience in the financial industry, I’ve developed a talent for distilling complex financial data into clear, concise and actionable reports that support executive decision-making. Senior leadership commended me at River Tech for my ability to think strategically and anticipate future industry trends and company needs. In late 2009, I developed a model that highlighted several market red flags; that awareness prevented the company from executing a merger that would have failed during the 2011 “Black Monday” market crash. I am confident that my extensive technical skills along with my proven track record of industry success would make me a great fit for guiding Cloud Clearwater’s market strategy. I’m looking forward to a having a conversation about the Financial Analyst position and Cloud Clearwater. Sincerely, Ivy Haddington"

When writing a cover letter, be sure to reference the requirements listed in the job description. In your letter, reference your most relevant or exceptional qualifications to help employers see why you’re a great fit for the role. In the same way that you might reference resume samples, the following Firefighter cover letter example will help you to write a cover letter that best highlights your experience and qualifications. If you’re ready to apply for your next role, upload your resume to Indeed Resume to get started.) Sofia Flores (123) 456-7891 sflores@email.com May 1, 2018 To Whom It May Concern, Many little boys and girls dream of becoming a Firefighter when they grow up. Rather than dreaming it so, I made it so and would love to continue the course of my career with the Crane & Jenkins company. I read about your opening for a new Firefighter and would be elated to join up. I feel strongly that my skills and experience would be a perfect match. My dream of becoming a Firefighter didn’t materialize out of nowhere. I actually began my service life as a Police Officer, albeit briefly. I attended police academy at Green Valley State, eventually passing and joining the force in town. The job wasn’t what I was best at, though. Instead, firefighting was where my heart was. From the academy, I spent time as a volunteer fireman. There are similarities between the careers. Both highlight my desire to serve and protect my community. Both require physical, mental, and emotional strength. These are all key aspects of my personality. I perform well under pressure and seem to rise to the occasion when there is a life to be saved. Combining my desire into a career is the outcome for which I was destined. Obtaining this position would be a dream, but it would also just be the start. I feel as though I would be a major asset to the Crane & Jenkins company. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to meeting with you to share how I will be a great fit for your team. Sincerely, Sofia Flores"

"Dear Hiring Manager, I am thrilled to be applying for the Human Resources Assistant position at Cloud Clearwater. With three years of experience in Human Resources, I am motivated to join an organization where I can contribute my unique skills and grow as a Human Resources professional. I am particularly adept at finding ways to streamline routine processes, thereby allowing more time to focus on the human aspect of the recruiting process. I am intrigued by the opportunity to bring my talent, experience, and commitment to helping people in a company like Cloud Clearwater, an innovator in the cloud computing marketplace. During my previous role at River Tech, I efficiently conducted approximately 20 applicant phone interviews each day and scheduled qualified applicants for face-to-face interviews with the hiring manager. I took ownership of coordinating logistics of the in-person interviews, allowing hiring managers to have well-prepared discussions with applicants and quickly move to making an offer. Ultimately, I was able to reduce the time-to-hire by 25%. I also used my strong organization skills and strategic thinking to revamp the new hire onboarding process.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I am interested in the Human Resources Coordinator position for Cloud Clearwater and the opportunity it provides to design e-learning resources for employee training and development. In my current role, my primary duties include guiding employees through the benefits sign-up process and ensuring that they follow through with evaluating and making changes to insurance benefits during the open enrollment period. Recently, I developed five e-learning modules that employees can access online to review their benefit options during the open enrollment period. The modules have been very helpful because employees can now review benefits carefully before they make decisions about changes or additions. Employees and family members can access the modules anytime. Prior to my developing this online presentation, employees were required to attend face-to-face benefits updates during the workday, prior to beginning work, or after hours. Upper management and my Human Resources Manager have been supportive and recognize that using technology is an efficient way to reach employees with important information. However, with limited staff, the company is unable to create a position specifically for this task. In fact, when I developed the modules, I did most of the work after hours during personal time. Based on what I know about your company, my ability to develop high-quality e-learning resources would be an asset. I have worked for five years in my current position, so I bring knowledge of many areas related to human resources, including interviewing, coordinating benefits, orienting new employees and writing articles for the company newsletter. I look forward to the opportunity to meet you and to discuss how I can design e-learning resources that will benefit the employees at Cloud Clearwater. Sincerely, Ebony Moore"

"Dear Hiring Manager, Once upon a time, my mom thought she lost me in the library, but I was actually hiding in the stacks, organizing the books in a dusty corner of the Green Valley State Library. Naturally, when I saw this job posting, I was thrilled to apply for the Library Assistant opening at Cloud Clearwater. I would love nothing more than to channel my near-obsessive love for organization and books to this position. While I have no direct work experience in the library science field, I have volunteered as the Library Assistant for Ms. Jenkins, the librarian at my high school, since I was in the eighth grade. For the most part, my job was to reshelve books, so I became very accustomed to the Dewey Decimal System as a point of interest and a necessity. Not only that but I also aided Ms. Jenkins in a complete revamp of our library’s technological system that, before our intervention, hadn’t been updated since the 90s, so I understand the databases and skills necessary to logically work in a library setting. I am confident that I am ready to take the next step in my journey to librarianship. I am comfortable with teaching patrons new research methods and helping book seekers use the catalog, and I am excited to start a new phase in my life as not only a Library Assistant but also as a lover of books, libraries, and everything in between.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I believe in good products. More than that, I believe in making good products into good brands. How your brand is perceived can drastically impact how your product sells. That’s where I come in. I have a proven track record at reviving brands, and I want to put those skills to use at Retail Ocean. I believe Retail Ocean could be huge, and I believe I have the knowledge and skills to help the company reach its full potential as its new Marketing Coordinator. At Coral Springs University, I majored in Marketing with a minor in Sales and Copywriting. While there, I became the lead columnist for our school paper, launching a new column called “Being the Brand” that featured different students and how they branded themselves for post-university life. Even in college, it became increasingly important to me to share the importance of brand awareness to the public, so I made it my mission to do so. After graduating summa cum laude from Coral Springs, I held a year-long marketing internship with one of the best and the brightest minds in marketing while working for River Tech Industries. There, I honed my skills as a quick-witted and creative thinker, and now I am ready to start my very own marketing career under the umbrella of Retail Ocean.

"Dear Hiring Manager, Marketing 101 at Coral Springs University sparked an infinite interest in marketing in a young, impressionable freshman sitting front row center, and now, as a college graduate, I am thrilled to apply for the Marketing Intern position with Crane & Jenkins. I am passionate about the new meaning of marketing, making things mission-based instead of sales-based, and I would love to channel my skills as the Marketing Intern.

During my time with the Housing Department, I learned to emphasize and treasure their brand and mission, and I would love to transfer that knowledge and passion to the Crane & Jenkins brand.

"Dear Hiring Manager, Thank you for considering me as a candidate for the Nanny position at Crane & Jenkins. My experience with children paired with my education in Early Childhood Development makes me confident that Crane & Jenkins is a place where I can add value. It would give me great pleasure to become a part of your team. As the oldest of five children, I played a major role in the upbringing of my two brothers and two sisters. My father was a hardworking man, but the role of child-raising was placed on my mother. As I got older, I began to take on more and more of the responsibilities associated with raising my siblings and running the house. As much of my time as it took up, I loved it. I knew I had developed a passion for caring for babies and young children. Their well-being was my biggest concern. As my siblings became more self-sufficient, I began a babysitting service for my neighbors. During my four years of high school, I babysat three to four nights a week, and overall, I cared for about 50 babies and small children. I knew I had already found my dream job, but I wanted to make a living wage. I decided to attend Coral Springs University.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I capture moments. My photography philosophy is to skip the posed, staged shots and get to the heart of the matter: love. From engagements to graduations to family photos, I work with love. In fact, I think that every truly beautiful moment deserves a photo to back it up. That’s why I do what I do, and I would love to join the Cloud Clearwater team. With my vision and your resources, I’m sure we could make memories that will last lifetimes. While studying photography at Hawaii Western, I began a small photography business to cater to those special moments we all have at university. I covered a few tropical weddings, capturing the essence of that magical time when man and woman become one, and I stood vigil as babies were brought into the church. Each of these affairs was intimate and full of emotion, and I was proud to be a part of their big moments, but I am ready to lend my talents to a larger firm. I created a portfolio of the most creative and special moments I caught on camera and have achieved them both at @HaddingtonPhotography and on www.HaddingtonPhotography.com. In addition to my favorite pictures, I asked each of my clients to pick their favorite photo to be featured on social media or the website and why they loved it so much. This, I believe, helped market Haddington Photography to where it is today, and I would love to apply this strategy to a new position with Cloud Clearwater. Thank you so much for your consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon. I can be reached at either ihaddington@email.com or (123) 456-7891. Sincerely, Ivy Haddington"
"Dear Hiring Manager, I’m excited to be applying for the Physical Therapist position at Cloud Clearwater. I am passionate about combining my knowledge of physiology with my clinical and interpersonal skills to create successful therapy plans and improve the overall patient experience. During my previous role at River Tech, I had the opportunity to work with a wide range of patients, including pediatric, adolescent, and special needs patients. I owned the development and implementation of effective pain management and mobility improvement plans for more than 150 patients. I was also responsible for developing and overseeing the company’s first in-home care program, which now produces almost 50% of River Tech’s revenue. In addition to my experience in delivering quality patient care, I have also taken on additional roles as a trainer and educator for new physical therapists. I developed a new hire training curriculum that reduced the onboarding period from 14 days to 9 days, and I spearheaded an innovative continuing education program that improved employee retention rates by 67%. This love of teaching also led me to create a personal blog showcasing proven techniques for improving bedside manner and enhancing patient relationships. The blog currently has more than 1,000 subscribers, ranging from first-year medical students to seasoned physical therapists. Thank you for your time and consideration.

During my previous role at River Tech, I regularly cared for 800 patients.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I am excited to apply for the Physician Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins. When I graduated from Northwest Vermont University three years ago, I knew that I wanted to work in delivering primary health care services because I believe that’s where I can have the most impact on the daily lives of people. I am intrigued by the Physician Assistant position you seek to fill at Crane & Jenkins because of the inroads you are making in community health education and improving health outcomes for underserved populations. With my Physician Assistant role at Cloud Clearwater, I examined, diagnosed, and counseled approximately 60 patients each day. My goal was to appropriately treat any acute conditions while educating my patients and their families to promote comprehensive wellness and maintain chronic illness treatment. To ensure all patient needs were met, I coordinated with the physician and health care staff while making referrals for additional intervention when necessary. In addition to my strong medical judgment and communication skills, I am adept at learning new technologies. At Cloud Clearwater, I established myself as the in-house expert on the DocuTAP Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. My ability to leverage technology resulted in me meeting our goal of an averaging less than an hour in-office for the patient. As such, my patient satisfaction rating was always 95% or higher. Thank you for taking the time to review my application, and I appreciate your consideration. I welcome the opportunity to learn more about the Physician Assistant position and Crane & Jenkins. I believe my ability to reach patients to help improve their health outcomes will be a benefit to your team and the community you serve. Sincerely, Sofia Flores"
"Dear Hiring Manager, I read your posting for a Pilot position for the King Air 200 route between Denver, Colorado, and Dallas, Texas, with great interest. I earned a B.S. at Green Valley State, where I completed my baccalaureate with a major in meteorology and a minor in public relations. Last year, I completed my flight training at Longford Tech’s flight training program. I believe I’d be an excellent fit as a Pilot for Cloud Clearwater Aviation. My current Pilot ratings are as follows: Private Pilot VFR/IFR, Commercial and Multi-Engine, and CFI II. It was through much hard work that I was brought on to work the flight line while at Longford Tech. During that time, I worked my way up and became rated as a certified flight instructor II in the institution’s King Air. I understand all that is involved in flight training and certainly understand that your company must carefully analyze all the credentials of each applicant. Therefore, attached are references from my previous and current employers that vouch for my integrity and confirm my safety rating in all my flying endeavors. I have also attached copies of my Federal Aviation Administration Licenses and ratings. Please notice the attached copies of my logbooks and the impressive quantity of flight time that I have earned while on this rewarding career path. Thank you for your consideration and time.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I’m very excited at the prospect of serving as a Police Officer at the Cloud Clearwater Municipal Police Department. I’ve been serving communities in my hometown since I was 17 and working as a Police Explorer, and I have always been praised for my commitment to helping community members in need. I have also been told that I am attuned to people’s body language, which further helps me identify people’s motives and solve problems. As part of my most recent role as Community Officer at the River Tech Police Department, I fostered relationships with employees at local public retail centers, such as gas stations, shops, and grocery stores. Community members in these roles can be eyes and ears for law enforcement, and gaining them as allies is helpful for obtaining leads during an investigation or while in pursuit of a suspect. It’s also important to gain the trust of community members because they will be more likely to call and ask for assistance if they encounter a patron of their store who is being disruptive on their premises or in the community. I am also attentive to procedures, and I am able to testify in cases that I have been involved with. My attention to detail has been noted on my performance appraisals, and I am often told that the reports that I write are impeccable and allow court proceedings to be conducted smoothly. Thank you for taking the time to consider me for the Police Officer role at Cloud Clearwater Municipal Police Department. I look forward to learning more about your department and the Cloud Clearwater community. Sincerely, Ivy Haddington"

Sofia Flores (123) 456-7891 sflores@email.com May 1, 2018 To Whom It May Concern, Upon noticing the opening for Preschool Teacher at Cloud Clearwater, I was compelled to apply. I feel as though I would be a valuable asset to the program and would love to come on board. Teaching young children has always been my passion, and Cloud Clearwater feels like the right fit for me. Though I am new to the teaching profession, I have spent my life preparing for such a career. The desire to help children stems from the jobs I had growing up including babysitter, camp counselor, and nanny. I enjoyed everything about the process of watching, teaching, and helping children. Their wonder-filled eyes and minds are meant to be shaped and aided. There is nothing more rewarding than doing just that. In addition to my work experience, my education makes me an excellent candidate for the job. I earned my B.A. in early childhood education at Hawaii Western, and I minored in childhood development. While there, I served at my local church as a Sunday School teacher for fourth and fifth graders. I have experience working as an assistant in the classroom. It was just the start I needed for this next jump. At the school, I was responsible for designing fun and engaging projects for the kids. This included making a game of learning letters and numbers. We gave backstories and identities to each symbol to ingrain them in the children’s minds. It was a fun take on the preschool lexicon, one that I hope to continue at Cloud Clearwater.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I am applying for the Production Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins Productions. As a Communications student at Coral Springs University, I am eager to take on a part-time or internship position. I work quickly and efficiently and am meticulously organized. I can craft and edit content while getting projects done on time. Putting my strengths to use, I am excited about the idea of helping Crane & Jenkins Productions, a company that produces first-rate entertainment. I was recently the Development Intern at Cloud Clearwater Pictures. A goal of Cloud Clearwater Pictures’ internship program is for students to get hands-on experience with the movie and television development process. While there, I researched pilots and films and helped decide which should go into production. I also managed desk duties, taking calls, responding to emails and setting up meetings. In addition, I helped talent and assisted with casting multiple features. As a result of my role as Development Intern, I have gained experience reviewing and editing books and scripts. I am also skilled at writing press releases, articles and pitch summaries. Some of the announcements I wrote have since been used to publicize some of the most talked-about projects in the industry. My supervisor set a goal for me to make decisions on 50 films and pilots during my four-month stint. I made decisions on 100, surpassing that goal by 50. Thank you for your consideration and time.

Sofia Flores (123) 456-7891 sflores@email.com May 1, 2018 To Whom It May Concern, I saw the job posting for the position of Program Coordinator at your facility and would love to be considered for it. I believe my strengths, passion, and experience line up perfectly with this opportunity, and I know I would become a vital part of the Coral Springs University team. Working at CSU would not be my first taste of program and event management in a collegiate atmosphere. During my time as a hospitality and tourism management undergrad at Hawaii Western, I interned with the facilities department. There, I received a crash course in setting up and preparing for large events. We also interacted with prospective and current clients and followed up with them after each event. After graduation, I moved into the nonprofit world. I worked as a Recreation Coordinator for the Parks and Recreation Department in Turtle Bay, Hawaii. While our events were normally on a smaller scale than they were at Hawaii Western, the steps we needed to take were similar. Coordinating an event of any size includes specific, necessary steps to make the client happy and guarantee the event proceeds as planned. Between my time helping with the facilities and events department to working as a Recreation Coordinator, I believe I have followed just the right stepping stones to becoming the Program Coordinator at Coral Springs University. I am familiar with an academic atmosphere and I love the enthusiasm that exists in such an environment. CSU sounds like a place that employs passionate and hardworking folks, which is just the kind of group I’d like to join as Program Coordinator. Sincerely, Sofia Flores"

"Dear Hiring Manager, I’m excited to be applying for the Project Manager position at River Tech. As someone with an eye for detail and impulse for organization, I thrive on keeping projects running smoothly from kickoff through launch. I’m eager for the opportunity to use my talents to move technology forward with River Tech’s innovative software systems. During my previous role at Cloud Clearwater, I worked on many of the company’s critical projects, including the redesign of our flagship CRM system. When an external issue derailed a crucial project milestone, I developed an all-team triage system to ensure other project sprints could continue moving forward. As a result, the updated system went live within five days of the original planned launch – an effort the CEO praised as “heroic and unprecedented.” I earned specific recognition for my ability to effectively delegate and keep myself and my teammates calm under pressure.

As an upbeat professional with over 10 years of property management experience, I am confident in my ability to perform at Retail Ocean. During my tenure as Property Manager for Crane & Jenkins, my responsibilities included calculating rental rates for our homes, advertising, showing homes to potential tenants, collecting rent, creating an annual budget, contracting repairs when needed and enforcing company policies. I interacted with clients and tenants in a professional manner and made sure to address any concerns as quickly as possible. Before I worked at Crane & Jenkins, I helped my father manage properties for his small business. He had 10 properties when I was 12. As his business expanded to over 30 homes and I grew up, I became more involved in helping him manage properties. He taught me how to interact with tenants and taught me what to do and what not to do when a tenant damages property or is behind on rent. I believe that a Property Manager should always be considerate of the needs of their tenants. My father never allowed a repair to go unaddressed. If a tenant called and said something was broken, he made sure to get someone to the property as soon as possible. I carry that same sense of urgency in my work.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Sales Representative position at Retail Ocean. As an educated and experienced marketer, I believe I can exceed your expectations and increase sales for Retail Ocean. My tenure at TradeLot proved to be a successful one. From day one I only gave my best. On the sales floor, I used many well-known marketing strategies as well as a few of my own techniques. During my first year, I increased sales on a product which had previously had not been selling very well by 50%. By my second year, I was a top five sales representative for TradeLot. Because of my success, I was able to attend several conferences, where I networked and learned new sales strategies from world-renowned experts. My demeanor as a sales representative is not pushy or “salesy.” I believe that if a product will truly benefit a customer, then it is my duty to make them see how. I take time to learn about the customer and match them with a product that is best suited to their needs. Ever since I was a child I have been interested in sales. I was always coming up with “products” to sell to my friends and family. From lemonade stands to peddling candy and duct tape wallets, I was born to sell. I saw school fundraisers as an opportunity to play salesperson even though I didn’t make any money from it. I loved the rush of getting a customer to say yes to a product. In 2012, I graduated with my degree in Marketing from Coral Springs University. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing more about Retail Ocean. Sincerely, Malik Rabb"
"Dear Hiring Manager, To change the life of just one child is my wish, and if I can do that, I will feel I have done something. I have spent the past four years at Northwest Vermont University learning how to be the best Counselor I can possibly be, and I am confident that I would excel in the School Counselor position at Crane & Jenkins Academy. At Northwest, I cultivated my love of human relationships by chartering a peer counseling group for our campus. Being able to help my fellow students get through their day-to-day hardships was an uplifting experience, and through that experience, I was able to learn about several different mental disorders and also about different cultures. Now, I believe I have a stronger understanding of what it is like to give of myself and to help people of all backgrounds. Most of all, this organization has refreshed my compassion and cleansed my sometimes jaded perspective. It is easy in this day and age to become bogged down by all the bad things happening around the world, but this position has reminded me of just how much good there is. I believe that with the right kind of motivation and support, anyone can make their dreams come true. I truly believe that my experience and my coursework have prepared me to be the best School Counselor that I can be, and I would love for it to be at Crane & Jenkins Academy. Thank you so much for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you. I can be reached at emoore@email.com or (123) 456-7891. Sincerely, Ebony Moore"
"Dear Hiring Manager, Considering my background in the physical sciences, I’m extremely excited to be applying for the Scientist position at River Tech. As a highly analytical individual, I aim to always make rational and objective observations about the world around me. I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to offer my talents to River Tech, which is one of the top research organizations in the business world today. While working in my previous role at Cloud Clearwater, I evaluated professional research as part of an internal self-regulation policy designed to maintain high standards of quality and credibility in various fields of scientific inquiry. Always on a mission to ensure complete objectivity in all of our projects, I made sure that all research met certain exacting guidelines before it went into any of the company’s publications. While at Cloud Clearwater, I was able to apply many of the skills I earned while majoring in Biomedical Studies at Longford Tech. Understanding that data-driven presentations are absolutely necessary when sharing complex scientific concepts, I proposed and carried out a plan to move our visuals to a new digital design platform that combines eye candy with hard facts that increased researcher participation by 40%.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Secretary position at Crane & Jenkins, the leading name in equipment rentals. With my education and work experience, I am confident in my ability to deliver as the Secretary at Crane & Jenkins. At my previous role at TradeLot, I provided secretarial and administrative services for an equipment rental company. I effectively performed tasks such as invoicing, client intake, paperwork, filing, managing all incoming calls, scheduling events, setting up catering and rooms for company events, and ordering supplies. I am well-versed in equipment rental jargon, and I have an in-depth understanding of the business. My education from Coral Springs University was in construction management. I also have a minor in business administration. I have wanted to study construction ever since I was a child as my father built and rented out houses. I was always fascinated by the tractors, backhoes, and excavators that my father used in his work. I helped my father a lot as a child; he even taught me invoicing at the age of 10. I performed many administrative functions for my father until he closed his business when I was 17, and those skills have proved to be invaluable. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about Crane & Jenkins and its clients. I am confident in my ability to perform as Secretary because of my longstanding history with administrative work in the construction field and my education. Sincerely, Ebony Moore"
"Dear Hiring Manager, I am excited to be applying for the Security position at River Tech. As a military veteran with years of security experience, I am confident in my ability to provide excellent security services for River Tech. During my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I was responsible for protecting the people and the property of the company. Each day I performed a morning and evening inspection of the premises. It was my duty to report any suspicious activity, and I avidly removed trespassers from company property. I also did preventative maintenance and open and closed the building. I monitored hallways and conference rooms onscreen from the security office. As a Marine Corps veteran, I understand the importance of safety. In the Marine Corps, safety was especially stressed when handling firearms. I am well-trained in gun safety, which I believe to be a vital part of an armed security guard’s job. I also believe in the importance of physical fitness as a security guard. I have made it a priority to keep up with my physical training so that I can perform efficiently in case of an emergency. I am a graduate of the Marine Corps Police Academy, which produces highly qualified individuals to protect the Corps and civilians. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing more about River Tech. I am confident that my background and experience, along with my desire to protect others, will prove me successful in the Security position.

Malik Rabb (123) 456-7891 mrabb@email.com May 1, 2018 To Whom It May Concern, I am writing in regard to the opening I saw for Security Guard at Retail Ocean. Your company seems like an exciting and challenging place to work, and I know I would fit right in. Thanks to my protective nature and past work experience, I would be a perfect fit for your Security Guard position. My career began soon after high school. I attended Longford Tech, and upon graduation, I transitioned into the workforce. I worked at TradeLot as a maintenance assistant for five years. This was time well spent. Not only did I learn the ins and outs of professional life, but I also gained valuable knowledge of what it meant to be responsible and accountable. From maintenance work, I moved on to Coral Springs University. I was working for the facilities department, and this proved to be a tremendous experience. The facilities department at a university is responsible for so many critical tasks: upkeep of the buildings, preparation and cleanup after events, and security of facilities and personnel. It was a broad-reaching and educational growth experience. Being a Security Guard at Retail Ocean combines a number of the factors I am looking for in a career. I enjoy the process and efficiency of securing a building, either overnight or during an event. A qualified Security Guard must serve as an impenetrable line of protection for the company, and I am more than up to the task. I am an open person with a friendly demeanor, but I have keen instincts and pay impeccable attention to detail. I will remain committed to ensuring that your business remains secure but also a welcoming environment. Sincerely, Malik Rabb"
"Dear Hiring Manager, I’m excited to apply for the Security Officer position at Retail Ocean. As a state-certified Security Officer, I have the training and credentials required to work and excel as a Security Officer at Retail Ocean. Before obtaining my Security Officer certification, I worked as a retail sales associate at a major department store.

While serving in the United States military, I gained valuable training, skills and experience in security operations. I also had practice in written and verbal communication.

I would love to learn more from the other teachers and bring my own ideas to the department to help make it even better. I have been a Special Education Teacher at Crane & Jenkins for three years.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I’m writing about the Veterinarian position in the hopes that my skills may be put to good use at Retail Ocean. I am a graduate of Green Valley State, where I studied biology and veterinary medicine under some of the nation’s leading veterinary minds. I gained my medical degree at Hawaii Western with the lone goal of becoming a Veterinarian, and now I’m excited about the possibility of working for you. My desire to become a Veterinarian began rather ordinarily. It grew from a love of animals as a child. That cookie-cutter origin story has led me to apply for the position of Veterinarian at Retail Ocean. Even though my desire for this position seems simple, I can assure you my passion and aptitude are not. My passion for helping animals took me to a local shelter. There, I saw some of the hardships that abandoned and sick animals can go through. As I searched for work at a clinic, my time spent at the shelter made me aware of how animals are treated by supposedly intelligent adults. It only stoked my desires to help and heal these creatures. With a medical background and an animal focus, there is no other career for me outside of veterinary work. I know Retail Ocean is the right place for me. While my experiences have brought me in contact with mostly household pets (cats and dogs), my studies have given me the knowledge to help many more animals than that. As one could attest to, it isn’t enough to love animals. You have to take those next steps to really make a difference. Sincerely, Sofia Flores"
"Dear Hiring Manager, I am writing to inquire about the Veterinary Assistant position at TradeLot. With a biology M.A. from Hawaii Western and nearly a decade of real-world hospital experience, I believe that I would bring tremendous value to the table. My wide breadth of knowledge includes extensive study of both the animal kingdom and the human body. In fact, while studying biology at Hawaii Western, I minored in zoology. Upon graduation, I worked as an intern at Cloud Clearwater Hospital. There, learning health and wellness techniques while treating basic injuries and illnesses was of vital importance. I learned how to organize patient lists, communicate with patients and families in a compassionate and productive manner, and supervise medical students. After a year of moving up from the ranks of intern, I was offered a Veterinary Assistant job with Crane & Jenkins. There, I was able to apply my skills in a setting that exposed me directly to animals. I learned important skills like how to work with frightened animals and how to administer appropriate dosages of vaccine medications. My experiences have allowed me to work with dogs, cats, birds, rodents, and even horses. Though I love my job at Crane & Jenkins, I’m eager to expand my skills and bring value to a larger and more challenging veterinary environment. I would be pleased to present references from my current and former employers, and I look forward to learning more about this exciting position. Sincerely, Sofia Flores"

My father was a welder his whole life. From a very young age, I took interest in what he was doing out in the garage. Though my mother protested, my father bought me a child-size welding mask. I was fascinated by the beauty of the flames, it felt magical to see two separate parts become one. Each day after school I would run to the garage to join my father on his projects. Welding made me feel powerful. After high school, I studied welding at Longford Tech, and became certified. I look forward to learning more about River Tech and the Welder position.

"Dear Mr. Jim Ellis:This letter expresses my sincere intent to be the next Special Education program manager for Sweetwater Union High School District. I am confident that my professional qualifications meet and exceed those demanded of this position. More importantly, I am a patient and a flexible team player, yet firm in my communications and decisions. These qualifications make me ideally suited to work in this multi-faceted environment.After my first year of teaching, it was very clear that I had a special bond with kids that have emotional and behavioral issues. Teaching them comes naturally to me and gives me a deep sense of personal satisfaction. As a disciplinarian, coach and tutor, I open up in this setting. Undeniably, watching students make improvements and sharing positive praise with parents are my most rewarding moments of teaching.My experience as a Special Education Teacher is what will ensure my success as program manager. I have worked with a diverse range of emotional, physical and cultural backgrounds and often consider myself a de facto site psychologist. More importantly, because of my history in the classroom, I connect well with parents. I am able to relate to all circumstances because I am rarely shocked. Rather than become emotional, I take a proactive problem solving approach. Through this strong relationship with parents, I recognize quickly the accuracy and efficacy of assessments.The recent completion of my administrative credentialing also makes me an ideal candidate for this job. I am readily aware of the procedures and guidelines set forth by IDEA, as well as other codes and regulations, and relevant testing and assessment models shaping the way we educate today. My belief is that when we, as educators and administrators, are competent and confident, everyone walks away happy.In addition to teaching, I provide behavioral consultant services to other district schools, assess instructional programs, conduct trainings and work collaboratively with teachers, parents, aides and support staff. In this capacity, I have gained a broader understanding for how public and non-public districts interact to best serve the needs of students. Working between districts has also granted me a big-picture perspective that I believe will help manage Sweetwater Union High School Districts budget. I intend to bring superb mediation and communication skills to the table that will ultimately save money and protect the rights of all parties.I am a true lifelong learner. I love to teach and learn, especially from kids. As such, I was especially excited to be recently nominated and awarded an ABA Certification scholarship and intend to start courses as soon as possible. This designation will further enhance my ability to be a bridge between special education students and the successful academic careers they deserve.While I recognize that I do thrive in the classroom, I am ready to move forward into a management position where I can serve many more young people with special needs, ensuring they receive the best services available to them.

I have been exposed to a wide variety of technologies in my career and consider myself to be very adaptable. Because of my breadth of experience I believe that I would make an excellent addition to your team. Sincerely, Kelly George"
"Dear Hiring Manager, I would love to apply for the position of Peer Study Team Leader for SOC100/150. I am very excited about this position, and I think that I would be a great fit for it. In my first year at the University of Toronto I won the Max Weber award for my grade in SOC101, and would love to help others find the same success.
It might sound nerdy, but there is nothing more rewarding to me than helping other people succeed. I have always had a real love for learning, and I feel most fulfilled when I get to share my love with others. This passion has guided me to leadership roles throughout my life. In high school, I made my money tutoring students in debate. I have since pursued training roles at all of my jobs, volunteered as a mentor with Ideas for the World, and have been a successful independent tutor. I was even recently promoted at my current job to the position of RES Analyst. In that role, I take statistics about our store performance, and use it to create training plans and develop the skills of people on my team. I would bring genuine excitement to my role as study-group leader, and would be willing to work really hard to help my group.
First year can be really hard, something I learned when I moved across country to come to U of T. Over the last three years, I have learned a lot of lessons about how to make it easier. I know how to balance learning to live on your own, with finding academic success, and having a fulfilling extra-curricular life. My experiences have taught me many strategies about how to transition into university. More importantly, they have allowed me to develop patience, determination and enthusiasm, three things that are really crucial when helping first year students. I would love to use my experiences to help other students have a better year.
As a final note, my schedule is quite flexible this year, meaning I could be available whenever needed. I am taking some time away from my job to focus on my extra-curricular opportunities, and this role would be more than compatible with those responsibilities.
Thanks for your consideration,
Sandy McLarker"
"Dear Katie, As an engineering student majoring in data, I have read your post regarding the internship role in being a data analyst/ visualisation specialist with interest. As a student from the University of Technology Sydney, my qualifications align with the practical and technical skills that you seek. My achievements on subjects that develop communication, data analysis and visualisation abilities constitute on my capabilities in the field. I am certain that I have what you need and would become a beneficial extension to the company. Over the course of my studies, I am capable in the design, innovation and development of dashboards and visuals alongside data analysis. My achievement of high distinction in the data engineering fundamentals studio and introduction to data analytics clarifies my ability in producing an aesthetical and user-friendly interface whilst working alongside team members I have met for the first time. In this project, we developed a web application for an accounting firm that determines whether a customer is a good or bad credit risk using python, html-coding and random forest classification. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed for employee browsing convenience. I have used these skills in developing functional dashboards in other subjects and for personal purposes. In addition to my teamwork experience in a practical environment, I am adept and confident in my communication and management expertise. This foundation was built upon my work experience in retail and countless group projects throughout my studies especially one that involved producing potential solutions to the scarcity of food for the ‘Live and Learn Vanuatu EWB Challenge’. Furthermore, I have lead most of these groups in the allocation and distribution of assignments. Please refer to my attached resume for additional information regarding my proficiencies and achievements. I am positive that I am the best fit for this job and would like to request for an interview to follow up on my background and expertise. Thank you for your time and consideration.

"Dear Hiring Manager, As presented in my CV, my university life was filled with side-project activities, competition participations and internship experiences. All these extracurricular activities brought not only awards and CV-friendly features, but more importantly, invaluable experiences, books and concepts I would not have tried otherwise, and project based thinking with a can-do attitude. However, life is an ongoing journey and I keep learning and exploring, currently doing online courses in Innovation Management (Coursera), The Art of Storytelling (Khan Academy) and Digital Marketing (LinkedIn learning). My practical experience might be categorised in three blocks: Creating solutions for given company problems - using a challengest.com platform, I have been working on real-life problems of particular companies including banks, reinsurance company, hospital holding company, Adidas, and IBM. This work combined research, customer identification and development, creative and out-of-the box solutions implementing entrepreneurial thinking, client orientation and feasibility of the solutions. Working on my own business project – as part of my internship at Crowdfundinghub in Amsterdam, I was working on my business project regarding office snack delivery. This work put me in the shoes of the entrepreneur and I used this time for stakeholder interviewing, prototyping and overall business model generation and creation. While applying design thinking and lean business model canvas, I managed to change the initial hypothesis and kept iterating based on the stakeholders’ feedback. On top of that, I learned the fundamentals of graphic design, online app prototyping, paper prototyping, and basics of Adobe Illustrator. Working for a startup as part of my master thesis – I was responsible for the overall go-to market strategy of the Honeylog startup – cyber security solutions for computer network. This work combined the spirit of the previous two blocks and, in addition, team work, communication with investors and funding seeking. Thank you for considering my application and I look forward to hearing from you. With Kindest Regards, John Williams"
"Dear Hiring Manager, As soon as I knew that Norwegian was currently hiring for Cabin Crew positions, I started building my application, I didin't want to lose this great opportunity of applying, in my opinion, to the top Low-Cost airline in the world! Since you are searching for Cabin Crew with experience, I’d like you to consider my application. I am open minded and capable of working in a big and diverse environment, with the enthusiasm and commitment that this lifestyle requires. I'm currently working as Cabin Crew for Ryanair, based in the Edinburgh Airport. In all my previous jobs, I've dealt with people and always provided an incredibly good customer service. Good customer service is always my number one concern and I consider it an obligation in any of my jobs. I worked in my City Hall tourism department with leading responsibilities. From guided tours through all the county, promoting our local products and monuments, to being responsible for the tourist office and for creating new experiences and events in order to promote our territory. My main goal was always customer satisfaction which always led to tourists to be interested enough to further discover our territory and history for themselves. I also worked as a Sales Assistant, which meant that I had to put all my effort in providing the best shopping experience, working towards the customers needs (customer service as a primary concern). Had many jobs in various social events, working as a bartender, waiter or a host. To sum it up, customer service has always been present in all my jobs. It’s what I love and will continue to do so. Some of my competences include: custom relationship management, conflict and emergencies management, dealing with customers, communication and flexibility. Beyond all my work experience, and no less important, it's all my non-professional experience. All my side projects, all the volunteering and all the organizations I've worked with (parties, local and youth ones) gave me an huge background providing me important tools to deal with every day life events and to be more capable of managing my own life, choices and my plans for the future.  In the end, all my past made me a more mature person and combining all my experience with the goals I want to achieve for the future, are the perfect match for me to become a Norwegian Cabin Crew. A company where I can deliver all my human qualities and my true self.I would welcome the chance to discuss all of this, making myself available for any kind of attempt of contact. I’m incredibly excited to send this to you and look forward to be part of your organization. Sincerely, Zayn Malik"

"Dear Hiring Manager, This letter is to express my special interest in discussing the Manager, Student Services position posted on the Higher Education Recruitment Consortium website. The opportunity presented in this listing is extremely appealing, and I believe that my experience and education make me a competitive candidate worthy of consideration. In my role as Associate Director with NYU’s Division of Programs in Business, I work daily in a variety of roles, where I am not just the administrator but also the gatekeeper, student services professional, faculty and instructional support whiz, and marketing and program development guru. I’m not only used to wearing many hats, I sincerely enjoy it; I thrive in an environment where no two work days are exactly the same. It is precisely my ability to establish and maintain strong relationships with faculty and students, along with my capacity to lead day-to-day operations, that I am seeking this position. In my previous role as an administrator with SUNY Empire State College, I received an ‘Excellence in Student Service’ recognition due to my ability to coordinate complex logistics in order to keep students engaged and making successful academic progress even when issues arose that were beyond the control of the institution. Again, this involved not only managing operations but communicating directly with customers. As a result, I believe my combined ability to successfully manage operations while also effectively interface with students makes me a prime candidate for this role. I demonstrate courage and optimism in the face of ambiguous challenges, for which there are no obvious answers—I am fleet-footed when work pivots, quickly making sense of the change so that I can point the team in the right direction.
I am curious and passionate about project management—the rhythms and dynamics that make it work, across a wide range of operations. I bring a fusion of systems thinking and creativity in my ability to generate original ideas, solve complex problems, and understand all the forces required to effect change. I love collaborating in teams of diverse talents and skills—and I help each person show up as the best versions of themselves. You will find me to be energetic, confident, and personable, the type of person on whom your faculty and students will come to rely. I also have a wide breadth of experience of the type that gives you the versatility for me to serve across the school in a number of contexts with confidence that the level of excellence you expect will be met. Please see my resume for additional information on my experience. I hope that you'll find my experience and interests intriguing enough to warrant a meeting, as I am confident that I could provide value to you and the school as a member of your team. I am very excited about this opportunity to work for The New School. I connect with your mission to create a progressive approach to continuing education. The core values of The New School, innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship are reflected in my own professional, and personal values, and I believe this alignment strongly supports my candidacy for this role.

"Dear Mr. Rick Morty, I am applying for the financial analyst position at the Charleston International Airport. I found out about CIA through my fiancé, who is a TA in the Financial Department. I believe I am a wonderful fit for the culture, work environment, and values espoused by Charleston International Airport. My skills in finance can help this organization improve functionally, thus, allowing for an even greater focus on improving the human condition and educating world-class leaders. Currently I am earning my BBA in Financial Management at Charleston Southern University in Charleston, SC. My desire is to put my skills and knowledge to use in a professional environment. I am in the Honors program and I am set to graduate with a 3.96 cumulative GPA and will be the recipient of the CSU School of Business Outstanding Graduate in Finance award. While I have been taking classes, I have also been interning with finance department for the Charleston County Aviation Authority. Through my internship I have gained finance experience, including working in accounts payable and receivable, handling CRM Reports, balancing credit card charges, reconciling bank statements, and logging remittance reports. I am very proficient with Microsoft Office including Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Access. I applied this knowledge in a business plan competition at CSU. My team placed earned first place; I primarily handled the financial statements for that project. While at CSU, I have also started an on-campus muffin delivery business (Sophomore year). I called it ""Moufflet"" and earned several hundred dollars of net income during the first two months of operation. Just so you know a little bit more about me, I started my own podcast, which I call ""Third Culture Journey."" It is geared towards people who grew up overseas (like I did) or who are in a transition phase of life. I travel often during summers and have visited many countries, including: Ukraine, England, Israel, Spain, Canada, Armenia, Iceland, and Senegal. I have been to over twenty countries and hope to continue learning about (and seeing) the world.  I believe travel broadens my worldview and helps me understand people better. Most of the trips I was on were work-related. I helped build a well; I translated for various teams; I assisted in renovating buildings; and I also helped lead at many different camps. I try and lead whenever I can to get more experience. I was the student body president at my High School, as well as the yearbook editor. At CSU I have served as a student government senator and as Chairman for the Judiciary Committee, as well as the Master-at-Arms. I used my knowledge in finance to write a bill about restructuring the tax system. It was passed through the SC Student Legislature, and was then sent to actual SC Legislature. With my experience and knowledge, my hope is to work for an organization like Hylant, with ideals and goals congruent with my own. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter; I look forward to hearing back from you. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, and thank you so much for much for your consideration.

"Dear Volvo Construction Equipment, My name is Ivan Llopis. I am incredibly passionate about all things engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence and control systems. Over the past four years, I have dedicated a considerable amount of time and effort to control theory and robotics. Then, about two years ago, I discovered Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It amazed me and I have been dedicating my education to that ever since. I have done a number of courses online, been reading a host of articles, even enrolled in two related courses this year at university. I cannot put into words how excited I am about the application of machine learning and AI to robots, and about the ways it can improve the things with can do with them. My last project at university was an implementation of ROS in a simpler version of the coffee bot you propose in this thesis work. The robot was only supposed to bring snack to certain landmarks in an office (we called it 'tables of the café') while navigating safely around obstacles. The robot used ROS, the navigation package and amcl to plan the route, and a Kinect camera to detect obstacles. The robot worked well, however, my mind is still coming up with new ideas for a more complete and advanced version of it. In order to do this, I wish to apply for the Thesis Work of Artificial Intelligence: Robot Café at Volvo Car Group. I am completely obsessed with robotics, and now that I have discovered the field of machine learning and AI, I cannot wait to put my talents at work in developing new and amazing things. As for my education, I have been working with recurrent neural networks applied to timeseries analysis and NLP, convolutional neural networks for image classification, feedforward neural networks, linear regression, reinforcement learning, decision trees and random forests, bayesian learning and clustering with k-means. The main libraries I have used in the lectures are Keras (Tensorflow), Sci-kit learn and WEKA. And of course, I have been working with ROS as well, both with navigation and with object and face recognition packages. If this is something that Volvo Group may be interested in, please do not hesitate to contact me and we will arrange a meeting. I would be really happy to hear back form you. I am a hundred percent sure that I would be a perfect match for this position. Thank you in advance and all the best to the group, Ivan Llopis"
"Dear Hiring Manager, My first introduction to the fashion world was a beautiful pair of quilted gray Tory Burch Reva ballet flats my mother bought when I was in middle school. It was from there I became hooked on the eclectic detailing and colorful prints that have branded Tory Burch as the highly revered American lifestyle brand it is today. Being that I owe my penchant for beautiful products to Tory Burch, you can imagine my ecstatic reaction when I saw the Summer 2016 Internship Program listed on your website. As a junior who is double majoring in Accounting and Marketing, I would be thrilled to work in either the sales or marketing departments, but I am open to other opportunities.

 Over the years I’ve maintained a sales focused career through a variety of jobs and internships. From door to door cold calling, selling clothes, and training employees to maintaining stockrooms, managing sales teams, and creating marketing programs, I have learned a wide range of sales aspects through the various challenges that have been thrown at me. It gives me great satisfaction to learn something new, assign me any task and I won’t leave until I’ve mastered it; I don’t merely thrive in stimulating learning environments, I delight in it.

 Not only will I get the job done, I will produce the highest quality of work; I pride myself on surpassing given requirements and improving upon each job to make it more effective. At US PIRG I “broke the rules” by tailoring their strict, prewritten speech to relate better to the public and my sales blossomed- I consistently raised 460% more than the daily-required amount. But I didn’t just keep this information to myself, I hosted interactive workshops with the entire cohort and together we helped the company surpass its summer donation goals by thousands of dollars.

 While I love seeing the numbers rack up, I recognize sales is more that. For me, sales is about the customer and I’m dedicated to making each one feel important. I don't just make sales- I make relationships. I am gracefully persuasive, never manipulative, and I have yet to meet a person I couldn’t win over. Once, a previous customer of mine even wrote to Madewell headquarters claiming she had “the best shopping experience of her life” because of how “helpful, friendly, and conversational” I was. My dad calls it the “gift of the gab,” I just call it second nature.

 In closing, I am overjoyed at the possibility of interning with Tory Burch and would love the opportunity to share how I will be a great fit for the Summer Internship Program. I truly appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.

Warmest Regards,

Ariel Winter"

"Dear Kimberly, I was excited to see Hummingbird' posting for the Director of Marketing position, not only because I am interested in becoming a contributing member of the Hummingbird team, but because I have watched and admired Hummingbird, from the beginning, with sincere respect and admiration, and am thrilled to see the company (and brand) growing in such a successful way. The integrity, values, people and products of Hummingbird resonate with my own life and career goals of creating and honoring a different approach to doing business; one where people, planet and profit are not at odds with one another, rather they work in harmony, to ""feed"" a sustainable and harmonious future. Though most of my professional marketing experience is with Organically Grown Company (OGC), I have worked within the larger organic food and products trade through volunteer boards, organic policy work, conferences, including serving as a leader in developing the Organicology conference, and public speaking. I am an avid networker, passionate about organic, fair trade and sustainable food and agriculture, and want to share that excitement with the world. I have in-depth marketing and communications experience, have done all aspects of marketing at OGC, from the ground, up to executive leadership. I have led successful marketing campaigns for both our corporate and packaged brands, by developing integrated marketing communications plans and doing a fair amount of ""guerilla"" marketing. My experience with B-to-B marketing, because OGC is a produce marketer and distributor, has taught me that relationships are key to success; relationships in the larger trade, one's own supply chain, with one's customers and within one's own organization. My experience in B-to-C marekting, particularly product brand development, has taught me that integrity of a product or business should never be compromised to make a sale, and that taking the time to do research in the supply chain, the target market and to have clear communication will make or break the success of launching even the best product. I believe I would bring unique and valuable strengths to Hummingbird' already talented team. I have grown my current team from two to five members in the course of five years, and have consistently been highly rated (average four out of five) in our annual 360 reviews by those I manage. My personal leadership style is one of collaboration, mentorship and development--I thrive on recognizing and enhancing the skills and talents of others, and giving team members the opportunity to truly flourish in roles at which they excel. I love learning and seek to develop my own skills both professionally and personally. We are all on a journey to be our best selves and are here to help one another reach our greatest potential. Working for a common goal, with an earnest and hard-working team, brings me the greatest satisfaction and sense of accomplishment. Through my own experience of being a part of a small and growing,  Eugene-based, mission-driven, organic business and helping it to grow to more than double its size in 14 years, I am aware of the opportunities and challenges that growth brings, and have experience and skills to bring to your team that will help navigate these successfully. I believe, at this point in Hummingbird' trajectory and in my own career, that there is a serendipitous cross-roads at which we intersect.  We could work together in fabulous ways!  Sincerely, Meghan Markle"

"Dear Hiring Manager, After a year of working as master 2 student directly in a scientific research setting, I am seeking to leverage my experience within the field of professional scientific research. Ideally, PhD position will allow me the opportunity to utilize my experience gained as M2 internee at the professional level. If you are looking for a passionate, dedicated and hard working profile along with strong communication skills and an experience in working on pathogens, please consider my resume attached with the application. I have done Master M2 “Therapeutic Innovations in Cancer” from Universite Claude Bernard Lyon1 in 2017. During the course of my master M2, I had an opportunity to work on HCV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma at Cancer Research Centre Lyon (CRCL). This internship inculcated many pragmatic accomplishments in me. As a result, I am fairly competent in following skills: cell Culturing; western Blotting; RT-PCR; working protocols in P2 and P3 laboratories; plasmid construction; flow Cytometry; CRISPR/Cas9 Technique; and scientific writing. Before seeking admission in Master M2, I had done my graduate degree, Doctor of Pharmacy, in 2013 from one of the leading national universities in Pakistan. Since then, every coming year has proven to be professionally more rewarding than its precedent. Working as a community pharmacist for a couple of years followed by a year of Chemistry and English teaching to high school disciples added a lot to my professional excellence. During all these professional phases, I have a history of proven results and profound findings. Given opportunity, I’m confident in my abilities to earn similar groundbreaking results while being part of your team.
For your convenience, I have attached my resume for your review. I would welcome the opportunity to participate in a personal interview to answer any of your questions and better present my qualifications. Please feel free to contact me via e-mail or phone call to arrange a meeting if needed.
I look forward to speaking with you soon and becoming a part of your team. Sincerely,

"Dear Hiring Manager, My name is Mark and I am a software engineer. I have been developing websites and applications for around 5 years. Most my experience lies in full stack development and linux server administration. I have worked with HTML/CSS, Javascript/NodeJS, PHP, some scripting languages like rust and a little bit of C# and Python.
While I am not actively searching for a position, I heard that there are some devops positions that are available and that happens to be the same direction that I want to take in my career. I also grew up playing pokemon stadium/red blue and yellow on my gameboy and nintendo 64! You will find high level summaries of my job duties/education history in my resume. If you want to see some of the projects that I work on in my spare time, see my GitHub profile: github.com/conneraiken and my portfolio site: fittedtech.com (recommendations, some portfolio items and more). If you check out my github, it is mostly boilerplate projects that are not finalized. I do not feel that they are accurate representations of the quality of work that I bring as a full time employee but it will give you a sense of the technologies that I work with frequently. Most of my work has not been open sourced unfortunately. However, I am more than happy to create a sample web application project to showcase my full stack/dev ops skills. Sincerely,

"To Whom it May Concern, I only recently discovered the Director opportunity for the HBP Incubator, but I am certain that this is the role I’ve been building towards my entire career -- a role that will have enormous impact through empowering others. I've orchestrated, qualified, and reviewed hundreds of initiatives within the Government and Business sectors.  In my current role at HubSpot, I frequently research, identify, and prioritize potential growth engines for over 50 businesses.  These businesses span all industries, models, and personalities. Furthermore, I've built several organizations via HubSpot’s Agency and Startup programs -- and am piloting an initiative I founded: “HubSpot for Veterans.”  I channeled my Startup Institute and Techstars experience towards a successful launch -- and the program’s continued impact on an ever-growing community of veteran and military spouse entrepreneurs.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I would love to come test the heck out of all things Android, well just all things, for Razer! I can't think of a better place to work than a company that has taken a passion for gaming and combined it with an attention to detail and a refined style that you can't help but pine for. I love hardware, more than most things, and I believe that all the work I've done up to now has been to get me ready for Razer. But you know, I didn't see the light until now. My love affair with hardware began straight out of college and hasn't stopped or slowed since then. I began my first professional days as a support dude for Quirky and Wink. This is where I first laid my hands on the command line, scratched my head until mobile device proxies made sense, and began looking to the cloud for my source of truth in the user space. I carried this new found love for testing and breaking hardware into my time at Lily where I, with my teammate, created a Beta program and preliminary product QA for a flying camera. A dangerous but exciting project. This was a pretty small team which meant it was a true learn or die scenario... and I loved it! Having to build a beta within CenterCode with no real background on the platform meant a lot of late nights, tons of tutorials, and one finely tuned beta at the end of it all.  Next was the world of mesh networking, and my valiant return to QA. My time at Plume was a dip back into the support world and one that didn't quite suite me. I knew then support just wasn't technical enough to keep me challenged, it was QA or bust. Joining eero gave me the ultimate opportunity to prove that I had the chops to test and verify with the best of them. Coming in with the bare minimum networking knowledge meant it was back to the books. If nothing else, succeeding at eero proved to me that there isn't a topic, language, program or a platform that I can't learn. I was able to come up to speed in a month's time and was busy owning regression for a dedicated node config two weeks later.   Being a fan of tech in general I find myself enjoying most of the products I've worked with over the years, but Razer is something entirely different. This is a company I have followed and championed for years, and one I would be honored to sign my name to in any facet. If I'm coming off strong it's because I'm coming from a place of love. I'm deeply committed to my work and the companies that give me the chance to prove it. I always give everything I've got to what I do and I truly want to bring that dedication and passion to your team.  Sincerely, Ken Thompson"

"Dear Hiring Manager, I have reviewed the job description you provided me with, and I hope you will find my experience relevant for the position. As a person who builds a career through challenges, and I am excited about the diversity and complexity of the role  and prospects it provides. I realize it will not be trivial, in fact, analytics is never easy. Fortunately, PepsiCo provided me with opportunities to work in a dynamic and changing business; here is where I learned how to deal with such a variety of products as we have in Pepsi, with a plenty of distribution channels and data sources. I suppose it is what you have RB, and as a huge company you want to make analytics clear, business oriented and actionable.

I never limit analytics work within a ""reporting"". I began my career in Pepsico participating in several strategic projects and that experience helped me to introduce my own projects and lead changes.

"Dear Pete, I have been following Ginkgo for a year and completely agree with this statement.  After seeing the recent opening on your Business Development team, I knew that this was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. At the Air Force Academy, I participated in the then-cutting-edge fields of industrial microbiology and astrobiology. Since then, I've found myself in several multifaceted leadership roles after completing my MBA and immersing myself in the Boston startup ecosystem.  Presently, I drive strategic partnerships within my current role on the Partner team and am piloting an initiative I founded: “HubSpot for Veterans.” While the past 2+ years at HubSpot have been the most rewarding of my professional career, I was originally attracted to HubSpot because of their status as “the” unicorn of Boston.  Since then, I’ve seen what it takes to go from scaleup to publicly-traded company and, like a number of HubSpot alumni that have gone on to other startups, I believe I can apply my unique experience to your Business Development team and further refine my passion -- and from that, my purpose.

"Dear sir/madam, As an enthusiastic participant in most of FAECTOR’s events, including the ski trip last weekend, I felt that I will love being part of the team that organizes such wonderful social events. Being able to see other students enjoy an event you worked on for the past weeks or months seems like so much fun to me! I am Sean Goedgeluk, a motivated Dutch student with an international mindset. I work hard, and I am proactive. My calendar is always up-to-date, and my personal organization is on point. I am honest and straight to the point and I will always try to help someone who needs it, making sure not to let my own work and plans suffer from this. I will also always try to include everyone into an activity. Now a little more casual: I like wakeboarding, skiing and snowboarding, travelling, being socially active, writing Christmas cards and having a great time with friends. Also, I like meeting people, so I would love to hear what keeps you busy! Almost half a year into the bachelor I feel like I am part of an energetic and enthusiastic group of first year students. Next to this, I met a lot of people from the other years, during the ski trip, but also at other social events. Among these people are great active members, who motivate me to become an active member as well and be part of a great group of students. Having been in some organizational positions, I know the ins and outs of being in a committee and project teams. However, there is much I can still learn, especially when organizing big events attended by a lot of students: From pure administrative and organizational tasks, to team-building and teamwork, to contacting non-active FAECTOR members. On the other side of things, there is a lot I can contribute to the committee. I have a creative mind and I like brainstorming about events and coming up with fun ideas. With my experience with project groups and a committee, I will easily adapt to the team and situation that might arise. Finally, I have had the opportunity to work with people from a lot of different backgrounds, this makes me able to work together well with almost everyone. Hope to hear from you and get the chance to organize some great events with you and a wonderful team!

"Dear Hiring Manager, Development goes hand in hand with destruction, which can interfere with people, the environment or both. It is more destructive when it affects the community and the natural resources because for there to be sustainability, the three environment pillar, social pillar and economic pillar should be in balance. Conflict arises when people fight for limited resources, which can come about through development, and this can be solved through laws and policies. I decided to do masters in Environment Governance after I read the book by Laureate Wangari Maathai, The challenge for Africa and realized the big role played by the environment, which unfortunately, is taken for granted. I realized that change started with me, and if I wanted a better future for the next generation, and to see Africa rise from its burden of gender inequality, poverty and disease, I needed to stand up and do something. Doing this masters course empowered me, and as Laureate Wangari Maathai said, you cannot enslave a mind that knows. From there, I went to do internship at Integrated Global Environment Strategies in Japan, which is a policy research institute. I got a chance to be on a research team for UNEP green economy report for Burkina Faso where I gained research skills. I also contributed to the Japan 2050 low carbon navigator whose main aim is to reduce Japan 1990 carbon emission levels to twenty five percent or less. While in the process, I got an interest in green economy and green jobs concept which seeks to value the human life. Also, I learnt how communities and informal settlements are marginalized with regards to security of tenure when I joined Pamoja Trust. I joined the team that was working towards creating voice and space for the urban poor. I am applying for position of community environmental legal officer in the Coastal region because I want to bridge the gap between law and policy formulation and implementation in the environment sector with regards to the marginalized communities. The constitution of Kenya talks about the environment protection and this is enforced in detail in the Environment, Management and Coordination act of Kenya. I would like to be part of the team that finds remedies for the communities to be able to live in harmony with the environment so that we can eliminate future conflict. I believe right governance and good policies, which are implemented well, are one of the key ingredients for sustainability. My goal is to ensure policies are implement.
Sincerely,

"Hello Planet Romeo, I am a passionate and experienced journalist committed to the brilliant potential of social media and its essential role within our LGBTQ community. 
Social media is such a powerful vehicle for communication. I see Twitter, Facebook and Instagram as platforms to cultivate change, growth and spread knowledge. Planet Romeo gives the gay community an online resource to connect, communicate and freely express themselves. It is potentially the Facebook of the gay community and could grow to be as intrinsically linked and useful to its users as the Mark Zuckerberg's Social media giant. In Ireland I worked in Television presenting Irelands first gay TV show. I organised and ran a gay comedy and improv club while also reviewing theatre and culture for online and print magazines, GCN, Totally Dublin and Le Cool. So as you can see my previous experience is multi-disciplined and varied. In all of these roles a conversation across Facebook and Twitter was essential to initially raise awareness of projects as they began but then to continue to breathe life into those very projects and keep them going when the projects went live. I am well travelled, from Tehran to San Fran. On all of my expeditions, social media and online dating apps were instrumental in enhancing my overall experience of a place and gave me an instant in road with locals to gain information on places of interest, to go on exciting dates and to truly experience the country with its people. Imagine using Grindr in Iran where the penalty for homosexuality is death? In travelling and in the workplace I am a great leader, kind, patient with excellent listening skills but I can also be a follower willing to learn from others. I am organised and very open minded. I also play Rugby, I play as a forward with the Lowlanders and have just returned from the Bingham Cup in Nashville Tennessee. 1400 Gay Rugby men and supporters. It was a social media orgasm and the team is already hard at work promoting online to bring the Bingham Cup to Amsterdam in 2018. The team has helped me to feel more at home in Amsterdam and their awareness of branding, social media networking and disciplined training has helped me to enhance my own skills in  social media. I have always loved Planet Romeo and would be an excellent addition to your team. Kind Regards, Joseph"

During the course of my work life, I have worked primarily with administrative assignments. I have my final exam for my office education on the 7th of February.  My apprenticeship at Knord in Lyngby has given me the opportunity to develop my personal and professional competencies further. During my time there, I have worked in a number of departments; Sales, where I was responsible for invoicing and order management. I have also worked in Logistics where I was a ‘problem solver’, where I had to work with the different departments to solve the issue at hand. I am interested in working with exciting and complicated assignments as I work well under pressure. I also enjoy routine tasks, which are just as important. I have excellent organisational skills and can quickly learn how to use new systems.

"Dear Hiring Manager, After looking at all of the agencies, I find yours most appealing and beneficial to my career. From theatre to runway to film, I have been told many times that I take great risks while taking directions well. Currently I am a Portland Fashion Week runway model and have represented big names like Paul Mitchell and Nick Arrojo. I have been working on the set of HBO drama series ""Here, Now"" with Director Alan Ball and earlier this year with Dean Devlin on the feature film Bad Samaritan.  In 2014 I fell through a ceiling onto my head and neck. I survived a traumatic brain injury, learned to walk and talk again, and then used my passion for acting to figure out how to remember again. I fell in love with acting like it was the first time, and I owe my recovery to memorizing lines, which became my therapy. I am a survivor, grateful for a 2nd chance at life. I will work harder and be more resilient than you can imagine. And if you get to know me, I'm sure you will find that my charisma and dedication will be an asset to your company.

"Dear Hiring Manager, My name is Mayank Bhushan and I am a data enthusiast. I graduated in Information Systems from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad in 2016. Whilst pursuing my degree and during my internships, I developed a keen interest in data analytics and chose to pursue it as a career. I have been working in this field for two years now.I have had the experience of working for a service based analytics company (Mu Sigma Business Solutions). At Mu Sigma, I got to work for a large US based retailer on problems of merchandizing and supply chain. I worked on long term projects for the company as well as quick turn-around ad-hoc projects. This experience helped me the learn the ropes of working as a data analyst. It empowered me with the tools and languages (MS Excel, SQL, R and Python)  which would help me tackle data problems. After a year and two months at Mu Sigma, I wanted a new challenge in a fast-paced environment and hence took up a job as a Lead Data Analyst at Housing.com. I quickly got up to speed with the real estate classifieds business and set out to solve interesting problems. My role here has been to empower every team with data for them to take data-driven decisions on their own. I learnt Tableau and built company-wide dashboards for Sales, Marketing and Business Strategy which helps them keep a track of the key metrics and indicators. I have performed and automated competitive analysis for the business to understand where we lead or lag in terms of the competition. I also got to work on product and web analytics technologies like Google Analytics and BigQuery. I am looking for a change at this point as my current company (Housing.com) is in plans to move to Gurgaon and I am not willing to relocate. I am looking for another challenge at a global company. I am interested and excited about the Product Manager - Data opening at Saavn. I am a music lover myself and I cannot imagine a day (or life?) without music. Music helps me get in touch with myself and has the power to influence my mood and lift me up every time I feel down. My favourite genres are pop, hip-hop, r&b and soul. I am excited about this role as it will blend two things I feel passionate about - Music and Data. I resonate a lot with the mission statement of Saavn and would love to have a part in fulfilling that mission. Best, Mayank Bhushan"

"Dear Hiring Manager, I was pleased to learn that ABC College earned top 25 placement in DEF Magazine’s list of America’s Best Colleges, and was intrigued by the callout to ABC’s admissions program. As enrollment numbers are declining on a national scale, ABC’s numbers have increased over the past two years—congratulations!
When I found the admissions counselor position advertised on Monster, I applied online within minutes. A proud alumnus of ABC College, I am intimately familiar with the college’s mission, history, academic programs and opportunities for student enrichment. During my four years on the ABC main campus, I served as a resident advisor (RA), campus tour guide to prospective students, freshman orientation volunteer and international student mentor. These experiences are indicative of my ability to recruit, advise and develop relationships with diverse student populations. Known for my interpersonal communication skills, I excel at building rapport with new/prospective students and family members and “selling” the features and benefits of ABC College. In my roles as an RA and student mentor, I advised and supported students on a range of personal, academic and college-life issues. I helped students: apply for and receive financial aid and work-study positions; take advantage of ABC’s programs, activities and resources
Navigate and resolve conflict with peers and professors; and adjust to and more fully enjoy campus life. Energetic and service-focused, I am passionate about managing strategic communications with prospective students and promoting the advantages of ABC College and its programs. I am confident I will exceed your expectations if selected for this position. May we set up a time to discuss ways I can contribute to the continued growth of ABC College? Please call me at (555) 555-5555 to arrange an interview. I look forward to hearing from you."
"Dear Hiring Manager, Ever since I started teaching at the elementary school level, I have been passionate in my commitment to three things: maximizing individual student performance, inspiring students’ interest in technology and instilling a sense of self-worth among all students. I have dedicated my career to each of these pursuits, as my enclosed resume will attest. That’s why I was excited to see the advertisement on Monster for an elementary teacher in your district. ABC Public Schools has earned a positive reputation for celebrating diversity, achieving academic excellence and using technology as a learning tool. It would be an honor to teach your students and serve a district that maintains high educational standards and provides students with opportunities for personal growth. My qualifications include 12 years of elementary teaching experience, MEd and BS degrees in elementary education, and a current senior professional educator (middle childhood) license in the state of Ohio. In my most recent position as elementary educator for DEF Public School District, I developed and taught 4th and 5th grade curricula. For more than 10 years, I provided effective classroom management, creative lesson plans, detailed student evaluations and highly praised instructional delivery. As an enthusiastic volunteer, I founded and grew the school’s after-school technology club, an innovative program that covered diverse technology areas -- from Internet security best practices to PowerPoint tutorials. The program became so popular that it was the school’s only after-school program that was consistently filled to capacity. Although I enjoyed my tenure at DEF Public School District, my position was eliminated last May following a round of layoffs. I am eager to resume my teaching career and would be delighted to interview for this opportunity. Please feel free to contact me at 216-555-5555 or email winifred@somedomain.com to set up a meeting.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I am a high school graduate with multilingual fluencies (English, Mandarin, American Sign Language); experience as a classroom aide; certifications in First Aid, CPR and Nonviolent Crisis Intervention®; and a love for working with children diagnosed with special needs. These qualifications make me well-suited for your teaching assistant opening advertised on Monster.

I gained experience working with students with a range of disabilities and learning differences within an inclusive classroom setting, and engaged young learners in activities to optimize their understanding of lessons presented. I am motivated to become a professional educator. After I have completed the first year as a teaching assistant, I intend to pursue a bachelor’s degree in elementary education part-time while continuing to work as a teaching assistant. My long-term goal is to serve ABC School District as a full-time educator for years to come. To arrange a meeting, please contact me at (555) 555-5555 or email jl@somedomain.com.

"Dear Hiring Manager, As an experienced, dedicated and AVA-designated veterinary assistant, I offer strong qualifications that match the requirements listed in your ad.
Despite loving animals for as long as I can remember, I never had any pets while growing up. My dad was allergic to cats, my sister was terrified of dogs and my mom wasn’t a fan of anything that might impact the tidy home she maintained. I tried to make do by substituting stuffed animals for the real thing, but it just wasn’t the same.
I longed to put my love of animals into action, so as soon as I was old enough I began volunteering at the SPCA. As long as I could be around dogs, cats and the occasional rabbit or ferret residing at the shelter, I was happy to clean cages, restock shelves, inventory supplies or greet visitors at the front desk. Of course, if I was assigned to interact with, feed, bathe or exercise the animals, I was thrilled. After volunteering hundreds of hours at the SPCA, I decided to pursue a career in pet health care. I earned a certificate from a NAVTA-approved veterinary assistant program, achieved the Approved Veterinary Assistant (AVA) designation and joined the team at DEF Pet Clinic in Sometown.
It has been three years since I started working as a veterinary assistant, and I continue to love what I do. I take pride in maintaining cleanliness of the clinic and ensuring the safety and well-being of all pet patients. Whether assisting veterinarians and vet techs with pet exams/procedures, educating pet owners on care concerns or performing administrative tasks, I strive to deliver an exceptional customer experience.

"Dear Hiring Manager, As you know, a day in the life of an HR generalist is multifaceted. We can go from managing full-cycle recruitment of talented team members to investigating FMLA or EEO compliance matters within the span of an hour. While confident in my skills across multiple HR practice areas, the driving force is my desire to elevate the performance and job satisfaction of our most valuable asset—the employees. I’ve spent the past six years working in the HR Department of DEF Company’s corporate headquarters in support of the 1,500-member global engineering group. After initial success as an HR assistant, I was promoted to my current HR generalist role.
My passion for people—combined with an understanding of HR best practices—has contributed to numerous HR initiatives delivering exceptional results. For example, my team and I: increased the employee satisfaction index 16% by spearheading a “Flexible Work Solutions” employment program (a first within the company). This innovative program promotes non-traditional work schedules, work-at-home options and job-sharing partnerships; created an ongoing training program on HR policies and SOPs that strengthened compliance, boosted morale and improved recordkeeping; and conceptualized, launched and staffed DEF Sales, a new department that provided needed sales and marketing support to field workers. Backed by a BBA in human resources, I’m committed to helping companies create winning work cultures and top-performing teams. I take pride in providing value-adding advisory and support services to my employers, and strive to serve as a catalyst for continuous improvement.
Please contact me at (555) 555-5555 or email lp@somedomain.com to set up a meeting. Thank you.

"Dear Hiring Manager, If you are searching for a pharmaceutical sales representative with the ability to maximize sales within an assigned territory, we should speak. Currently a loan officer, it is my goal to leverage my relationship-building and strategic-sales skills to transition from the mortgage industry to the pharmaceutical sales sector. I started contemplating this career change after graduating from Brooklyn College with a bachelor's degree in biology in 2007, but I wanted to take steps to prepare for the transition. In the last few years, I have been mentoring under an experienced pharmaceutical sales rep (who currently works for ABC Co.), and studying pharmaceutical product lines across various therapeutic classes. Armed with this industry research and product foundation, I am confident that I would be a successful rep for XYZ Corporation. I also developed skills in the mortgage industry that are relevant to pharmaceutical sales. The loan process is highly consultative, and I demonstrated strengths in building positive relationships, offering excellent customer service and coaching clients throughout the process. Always focused on exceeding production goals, last year I: originated and closed $8.5 million in residential loans; held ""Top Loan Originator"" honors for the NY region; and earned ""Top Producer"" ranking for GHI Loan Company, sourcing a partnership that enabled a new product offering. You should know that I love selling, meeting new people and aggressively following up on all leads. I am also very comfortable using medical terminology and interacting with healthcare professionals.

"Dear Hiring Manager, Thank you for meeting with me this morning to discuss the executive assistant position. I enjoyed our conversation, and I am very excited about the possibility of joining your team. I know what it takes to run a busy and successful insurance office. In my last position as an administrative assistant for XYZ Company, I helped manage all aspects of the operation, handling tasks such as bookkeeping, customer service, claims processing, report preparation and ongoing communications with the district manager. You mentioned that you need an assistant who has strong “people” skills, and this is an area in which I excel. At XYZ Company, I helped the manager build a loyal client base by consistently providing excellent service. My last supervisor said, “John is one of the hardest-working employees I have known. His friendly and professional customer-service skills helped the firm achieve a 20 percent revenue increase last year, and I couldn’t have done it without him.” I don’t see the executive assistant role as a punch-the-clock, 9-to-5 job; I will be your “right hand”—helping you manage the day-to-day operations, volunteering for special projects, and ensuring the company is positioned for growth and increased profitability. Again, thank you for considering me for this exciting opportunity. As you requested, I’m enclosing a list of professional references. Please feel free to call me if you need additional information, have any questions or would like to offer me the job! Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

"Dear Hiring Manager, As an accomplished purchasing specialist with extensive healthcare industry experience, I was very interested to learn about your purchasing specialist opening. I offer eight years of experience working for ABC Company, a national home healthcare company and a billion-dollar leader in the industry. As the company’s corporate purchasing specialist, I managed purchasing functions for 115 locations and 75 major contracts in areas including medications, supplies, equipment, furniture, uniforms, distribution and vending machines. Consistently recognized for outstanding performance, I saved ABC Company more than $5.3 million in 2015 alone. An expert in contract negotiations, vendor management and global sourcing, I repeatedly reduced expenditures, cost-of-sales (COS) and cost-of-goods (COG), as well as assisted with major system implementations of inventory, purchasing and tracking systems. In 2016, ABC Company experienced a significant workforce reduction and my position was eliminated. Since then, I have remained active in the American Purchasing Society and completed courses in business ethics, contract law, the art of negotiation and supply chain management. I plan on sitting for the Certified Professional Purchasing Manager (CPPM) exam later this year. I am confident that my ongoing studies combined with successful experience in the field will enable me to aggressively pursue cost-reduction opportunities and improve return on investment (ROI) for your company.

"Dear Hiring Manager, As a Texas-certified firefighter backed by EMT and First Responder certifications, I offer the precise qualifications you are seeking for your firefighter opening. My background includes in-depth knowledge of firefighting, fire-suppression and fire-prevention techniques and procedures; a solid foundation in hydraulics principles; and skills in emergency medicine and HAZMAT handling. The enclosed résumé provides details of my training, skills and achievements relative to firefighting, so I’d like to use this cover letter to tell you a bit more about my personal story. I’ve wanted to be a firefighter for as long as I can remember, and that dream became a reality three years ago when I joined Fire Station #4 in Sometown, TX, after earning my Associate of Fire Science degree. I am the latest in a long line of Blackwells to become a professional firefighter¾my grandfather, father and older sister preceded me in what we refer to as “the family business.” Six months ago my wife’s father was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, so we relocated to Somecity to assist with his care. I had hoped to join Somecity’s fire department, but shortly after our relocation the mayor announced the hiring freeze due to budget cutbacks. Realizing it was time for “Plan B,” I was hired as an EMT for a private ambulance company, and have been serving in that role for the past five months. My work for ABC Emergency Services has allowed me to continue practicing my first-responder and lifesaving skills, and it has given me intimate familiarity with the street systems and physical layout of Somecity. I’ve also kept up with the same fitness regimen I maintained while serving as a firefighter, which includes CrossFit® workouts.
You can imagine my surprise and excitement when I found the Somecity firefighter job announcement on Monster. I understand competition for this position will be fierce, but can assure you that if selected, I would give my all to serving my fire chief, fire captain, fellow crew and community with excellence. I appreciate your time and look forward to your response.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I am writing to apply for the judicial clerkship for the Supreme Court of Virginia advertised on Monster. As a recent honors graduate of XYZ University Law School, I offer a record of achievement both in the classroom as well as through experience a judicial intern for The Hon. Walter Jeffries (4th Circuit Court of Appeals, Commonwealth of Virginia). For the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, I was chosen for a highly competitive judicial internship. I helped with docket management, performed legal research for civil and criminal cases, drafted memoranda for judicial opinions and assisted the judge during appeals and other court proceedings. My work for The Hon. Walter Jeffries cemented my passion for appellate law, and I was described by the judge as “…one of the finest judicial interns I’ve ever worked with…demonstrated a discerning intellect and substantive knowledge of the law and applicable standards for case review and appeals…a hard-working individual with a clear passion for and promising future in appellate law…” — The Hon. Walter Jeffries, 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, Commonwealth of VA. During my yearlong participation in the Innocence Project, I helped investigate and litigate wrongful convictions of inmates throughout the Commonwealth of VA. In this role, I interviewed potential clients and witnesses; reviewed case files and collected records; and drafted pleadings and briefs. One of the cases my team worked on led to the reversal of a wrongfully convicted death row inmate, and also helped change state laws regarding exculpatory evidence. Since I plan to practice in the area of appellate law, this clerkship would be an invaluable experience and opportunity to learn more about the inner workings of Virginia’s highest court of appeals. If selected, I will be focused on exceeding your expectations and serving the court with excellence and integrity. I can be reached at (555) 555-5555 or mb@somedomain.com. Thank you for your time.

"Dear Hiring Manager, I am eager to join forces with ABC Company as your new property manager. With five years of experience as a property manager for a large apartment complex, complemented by 12+ years of prior success as a leasing consultant and licensed general contractor, I offer a “three-for-the-price-of-one” hiring advantage over other candidates you may be considering. After earning a BS in Construction Engineering and Management (BSCEM) from Sometown University, I spent the first decade of my career as a general contractor for a leading homebuilder. Business was good, and I delivered dozens of residential developments. But when the recession hit and the real estate bubble burst, I found myself out of work along with many other construction industry professionals. I found a new home with XYZ Company as a leasing consultant, delivering goal-surpassing results such as 99% occupancy for the company’s 400-unit high-rise condominium complex. This success led the CEO to offer me a promotion to my current position—property manager for XYZ’s newly opened, 750-unit luxury apartment complex. In this high-visibility leadership position, I supervise a team of 15 leasing consultants, property engineers and support staff. My construction industry knowledge and contacts have enabled me to reduce maintenance costs by 18% annually. I have surpassed goals in other KPI areas, including rent growth (12% over goal), occupancy (consistently at 99%—8% above goal), resident satisfaction (25% over goal) and quick leasing of vacant units (accelerating the typical vacancy-to-lease timeline threefold). These and related results are detailed in my attached résumé, and are reproducible for ABC Company. I will call your office on Monday to schedule a convenient time to discuss this opportunity. Thank you.

I’ve contributed to the business winning local awards, including Sometown’s “Best Cup of Coffee,” “Best Coffeehouse” and “Best Place for a Coffee Date.” During my career as a professional barista, I’ve earned a reputation a “Java Jedi”: With A-Z coffee knowledge that spans everything from Americano drinks to Zimbabwe bean blends, I’m affectionately known as the “Java Jedi” by customers and co-workers. I take pride in delighting customers and generating impressive revenues. Examples include my “Cinna-S’more” coffee roast blend (a top seller during the 2016 and 2017 holiday seasons) and “Mocha Madness” iced and hot beverage recipes (local favorites that are highly Instagrammed). A Planner of Sales-Driving, Community-Minded Events: I’ve helped organize events that increased sales and promoted strong business-community ties, including high school art exhibits, an espresso-tasting fundraiser for Sometown Opera and food drives for Sometown Food Bank.

What motivates me is brightening a customer’s day; advancing community goodwill; and creating a thriving, local “hub” where people can gather to enjoy lively conversation, find a homey second office, escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life, support local artists and, of course, enjoy a great cup of coffee. After 25 years in business, XYZ Coffeehouse is preparing to close its doors permanently. If you agree that I’m the type of customer-centric and innovative barista you are seeking, please contact me at (555) 555-5555 or email jm@somedomain.com to schedule a meeting. Thank you.

"Dear Hiring Manager, As a devoted customer and fan of ABC Bar & Restaurant, I would jump at the chance to join your team. I applied for the bartender position as soon as I saw your ad on Monster. A veteran of the hospitality industry, I offer 10 years of experience as a bar-back and bartender within luxury 4-star hotels and 5-diamond resorts. For the past 3 years, I have served as an on-call bartender at DEF Restaurant, a Michelin 3-star-rated gourmet restaurant and lounge within GHI Hotel. Previously at XYZ Resort, I was promoted from bar-back to bartender, where I primarily worked at the poolside Kona Kai Bar. During my tenure with both employers, my commitment to providing exceptional customer service has been repeatedly praised, and I have demonstrated the ability to thrive within busy environments requiring a high level of efficiency.
I also earned a reputation as a mixology master with an encyclopedic knowledge of both classic and trendy cocktail recipes (from Alabama Slammers to Zombie’s Brews and everything in between). Well-versed in luxury service standards and liquor laws, I hold current state- and county-issued Food Handlers and Liquor Cards as well as TIPSÒ certification. Additional qualifications include experience performing opening and closing duties; completing sales reports and bar inventories; and maintaining a clean, safe and positive work environment. Although successful in my present bartending role, the on-call nature of the position does not allow me to work as many hours as I would like. I am interested in securing a full-time bartender position within a luxury resort setting. I have been a regular guest at ABC Bar & Restaurant for years, and believe my dedication to sales and customer service would be a good fit for your establishment. You can call me at (555) 555-5555 or email mt@somedomain.com to discuss the position.

In addition, I am experienced in meeting special dietary needs and requests, including gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan, low-calorie, low-carb and dairy-free meals.

"Dear Ms. Jessica Tilman, In my five-year career as a paralegal, I have honed my legal research and writing skills, and the attorneys I've worked with have complimented me on my command of case law and litigation support. Spiegel Law Firm�s 20 years in practice proves that the firm has strong values and excellent attorneys, which is why I want to be a part of the Spiegel Law Firm team. I currently serve as a paralegal for Chandler LLC, where I work closely with the partners on a number of high-priority cases. During my time here, I implemented a new calendar system that ensures timely filing of court papers. This system has prevented missed deadlines and allowed for better organization of internal and client meetings. Previously, as a paralegal for the Neuerburg Law Firm, I received praise for my overall support of the legal team and my positive attitude. My further qualifications include a bachelor's degree from Rutgers University, a paralegal certificate, and training in LexisNexis, Westlaw, and Microsoft Office Suite. I would love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your legal team. Thank you in advance for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, Chase Broadstein"
"Dear Russ Roman, I've been following Vitabe for years, and can proudly say that I open every single email you send to me. This is why I'm thrilled to submit my application for a role as email marketing manager at your company. I have over four years of experience working in the email marketing space. In my current role at Westside Bank, I was able to implement new email campaigns centered around reengaging churned clients. By analyzing data around the types of clients who churn and the engagement of our current email subscribers, as well as A/B testing headlines and newsletter layouts, we were able to increase email subscribers by 15% and convert 30% of those subscribers to purchase our product, a significant increase from the previous year. I also launched a newsletter focused on educating our clients on how they spend and manage their credit which became our highest performing campaign in terms of open-rates and click-through to date. Previously, as a member of the marketing team at Dream Diary Mattresses, I collaborated with the sales and product team to understand how I could best support them in hitting their quarterly goals. One specific project involving creating personalized emails for customers drew more people to come back to our site after 30 days than direct paid ad campaigns, leading to a 112% increase in revenue from the last quarter. I take the content I write and the calendars I manage seriously, editing and refining to the point beyond being detail-oriented into scary territory, and I feel my experience and drive would greatly help Vitabe further develop their email program for success. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, Lad Miller"
"Dear Mr. Kolsh, As an editorial assistant for The Improv Group for the past two and a half years, my main responsibility was to get all of our content ready to go live. This included a final round of proofreading, adding in HTML where necessary, fact-checking, and finding photos, videos, and GIFs that would complement the content and optimize audience engagement. As I tinkered with each post, I became intimately familiar with our internal CMS and what makes a piece perfect. But, by far, my favorite aspect of this role has been writing. Each week, I pitch and write at least one article, from 250-word news items to 900-word advice pieces to even longer personal essays. I love the challenge of developing pitches that align with the trends we see in the data, fit in with the company's brand and mission, and allow me to flex my creative muscles. Collaborating with my team to form the best content library we can has been a dream come true. I am ready to use my experience to help Arabesque Weekly achieve all its big and small goals. And I hope to one day write a story that another child tapes to their wall forever. It would be an honor to be a part of your editorial team, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing the opportunity with you. Sincerely, Marlee Wood"
"Dear Maria Ross, For three years, I worked in lockstep with a busy, growth-oriented sales leader to support the business development team. As the sole administrative assistant in the department, I balanced a swath of competing priorities, ranging from data entry and meeting coordination to contacting customers, finalizing transactions, and creating promotional materials. This role helped me to develop a comprehensive understanding of the sales cycle, sales strategy, and pipeline growth. Like many others, my career path hasn't been entirely straightforward. After leaving Crabapple Media, I enrolled in a local coding training program. Six months later, I emerged with a certificate in computer programming and a certainty that I did not want to be a coder. But education is never wasted. I'm now an aspiring sales representative with experience supporting a thriving sales team and extensive knowledge of the tech space. At Crabapple Media, I assisted in coordinating three annual sales strategy rollouts, each yielding a 26% increase in pipeline YoY. At Sunshine Inc., I supported 12 independent team members in their lead generation efforts. I also assisted in processing an average of 300 sales transactions every quarter. I thrive in busy, ever-changing environments that require me to communicate clearly and concisely. Supporting a high-volume team and a busy executive helped me gain these skills. I typically sent more than 200 emails a day! I would, of course, love to schedule a time for us to discuss this role and my experience, and I truly want to thank you for considering me. All the best, Jaclyne Dean"
